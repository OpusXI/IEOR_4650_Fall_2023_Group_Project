# Group Project (IEOR 4650 Fall 2023)

Welcome to FutMoneyBol! This is a project designed to build a performant team given a budget and other user constraints. If you were to download the zip, simply run the gui.py file in order to launch the user interface. It will pull the pre-scraped data from the data folder. If you were to rerun the scrapers, be warned, they do take many minutes to run (i.e. the market value scraper takes upwards of 50 minutes). Thanks for checking out our project!
